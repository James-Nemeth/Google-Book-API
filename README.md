# Google Books

## Things to do:

Create a page that allows users to search for books
Page should include the following:

- Header section introducing the page
- Form containing a text input and a submit / search button

- A grid of books
  Instructions:

- When the submit button is clicked you need the request books from the Google books API using the input value as your query string
- The books that you receive should be rendered in the books grid.
- Each book in the grid should have an image, author, title and description
- The grid should be responsive on different screen sizes

Application Design (required):

- Remember that some JavaScript logic, like functions that fetch data, can be moved to their own .js files
- Always use iterators over loops
- Always parametrize and abstract large pieces of duplicate code.

- Give feedback to the user when no book results can be found for the query.
- When a user clicks a book in the grid, a modal should appear with more book information, think about release, publish date, country, languages, etc.
